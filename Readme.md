# PDF Viewer for WinForms - Replace Standard PDF Viewer Control Command with a Custom Command

This example shows how to modify the functionality of an existing PDF Viewer command.

## Implementation Details

The WinForms PDF Viewer exposes the [IPdfViewerCommandFactoryService](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraPdfViewer.IPdfViewerCommandFactoryService) interface that enables you to substitute the default command with your own custom command.

Create a custom command class (e.g., a <strong>CustomNextPageCommand</strong> class), inherited from the command that you wish to replace (e.g., [PdfNextPageCommand](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraPdfViewer.Commands.PdfNextPageCommand)). Override the required method of the command. The main functionality and command specifics is located in the<strong> Execute</strong> method.

Create a class (e.g., <strong>CustomPdfViewerCommandFactoryService</strong>) implementing the <strong>IPdfViewerCommandFactoryService</strong>. Override the <strong>CreateCommand</strong> method to create an instance of a custom command class if an identifier of a certain command is passed as a parameter. Use the created class to substitute the default PdfViewer's service.
